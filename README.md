# PiNthDigit
# Problem:
Find PI to the Nth Digit - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

# SOLUTION
To find PI value, program uses formula: PI = atan(1) * 4. PI value is stored in double type. To show value in precision, program uses command std::setprecision. Maximum value of precision is defined by DBL_DIG.
